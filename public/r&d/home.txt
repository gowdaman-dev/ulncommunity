### **Navbar Structure**

   - Link: Home page

2. **Navigation Links:** 
   - **Home** (links to the homepage)
   - **About Us** (links to the About page)
   - **Services** (dropdown menu with service categories)
     -   
     - Mobile App Development
     - Custom Software Solutions
     - API Development & Integration

   - **Contact Us** (links to the Contact page)

3. **Call-to-Action Button:**
   - **Get a Quote** (styled as a button, stands out from the rest of the navbar links)
   - Position: Right side

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Mobile Version:** 
     - Hamburger menu on the right side.
     - Expandable with a sliding drawer for the full menu.
     - "Get a Quote" button remains visible, possibly as a sticky footer button.

5. **Sticky Navbar (Optional):**
   - As the user scrolls, the navbar remains at the top of the screen, ensuring quick access to all sections of the site.

### **Visual Design Ideas:**
- **Color Scheme:** Match the navbar colors with your overall branding—maybe a dark background with light text or a translucent effect.
- **Typography:** Use a clean, sans-serif font that’s consistent with the rest of your site.
- **Hover Effects:** Subtle animations or color changes when hovering over links to improve interactivity.

This navbar structure ensures that visitors can easily find their way around the site while also having quick access to key actions like getting a quote or contacting you.
